  ## Usage

  Begin the application by running the command `npm start`. Team Builder 3000 will then ask you some questions about the individual members of your team. A team manager is required, then you can add as many engineers and interns as you like. After you've finished building the team, select "I am finished building my team." and your webage will be generated. Each employee will have a card displayed on the HTML page displaying their relevant work information. Styling provided by bulma!
